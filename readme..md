Request for Proposal: AI-Powered Web Crawler

1. Purpose & Background
MazikUSA seeks proposals to develop an AI powered web crawler. The crawler will automatically identify and evaluate public procurement opportunities at the U.S. state or county level, focusing specifically on Microsoft Dynamics, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), and staff augmentation initiatives. In addition, the solution must provide a mechanism for scanning corporate press releases from Fortune 500 and mid sized companies for technology initiatives.
A well written request for proposal (RFP) should facilitate fair competition, clearly convey the government’s requirements, identify evaluation and award criteria, and specify the information required from offerors acquisition.gov (TBD).
2. Objectives
1. Pilot Deployment – Deliver a proof of concept crawler targeting one pilot state or county to validate the solution’s effectiveness before a larger rollout.
2. Opportunity Identification – Crawl government websites (state, county, municipal) with open tech/AI opportunities and detect whether vendor pre qualification or registration is required; flag opportunities requiring pre approval separately.
3. Discretionary Opportunities – Highlight smaller discretionary opportunities below bidding thresholds so new vendors can bid without restrictive requirements.
4. Eligibility & Submission Guidance – Extract eligibility requirements, submission deadlines, and application instructions. Automatically generate basic response templates or route complex cases for manual follow up.
5. Corporate Press Releases – Provide an option to scan corporate press releases (Fortune 500 or mid size firms) for AI or tech initiatives as a secondary source of opportunities.
3. Scope of Work
To design, develop, and deliver a comprehensive solution with the following capabilities:
• Web Crawling & Data Scraping – Crawl and scrape data from public government sites (state, county, municipal) and corporate press release portals.
• Prequalification Detection – Implement logic to detect and flag opportunities that require vendor pre qualification or registration.
• Category Filtering – Filter results to Mazik relevant categories such as Dynamics, AI, IoT, ERP, and staff augmentation.
• Data Population Automation – Use existing organizational data to automate application forms or templates where possible.
• User Interface / Dashboard – Provide a dashboard for users to review opportunities, view flags, and manage follow ups.
o Contact details, book the appointment , etc.
• Scalability – Ensure the solution can scale to additional states or counties beyond the pilot region. Also, filtering of different domain other than IT, like hardware , construction,
• Extensibility – Design an architecture that supports scanning corporate press releases for technology initiatives.
4. Deliverables
The proposal should include, at a minimum:
1. Technical Architecture and Design Documents – Comprehensive design documentation describing the solution architecture, data processing, and security controls.
2. Working MVP Crawler – An operational proof of concept crawler for the selected pilot state or county, demonstrating the ability to identify and flag relevant opportunities.
3. Opportunity Capture Metrics – Evidence that the system can capture at least 2–3 qualified opportunities per week during the pilot.
4. Documentation and Training Materials – User manuals, installation/configuration guides, and training materials.
5. Roadmap for Scaling – A plan outlining how the solution will scale nationally and incorporate corporate targets.
5. Response Requirements (TBD)
Must provide the following information in their proposal:
• Technical and Business Approach – A detailed description of the proposed methodology for meeting the objectives and scope.
• Team Credentials – Resumes or bios of key personnel demonstrating relevant experience in AI development and web scraping technologies.
• Relevant Experience – Examples of similar projects, including contact references.
• Project Timeline – Major milestones and estimated dates for development, testing, and deployment.
• Pricing Structure – Itemized cost estimates, including any licensing fees or recurring costs.
• Assumptions and Dependencies – Any assumptions made in the proposal and dependencies on third party services or data sources.
A well written RFP should clearly state the requirements and identify the evaluation criteria acquisition.gov. Vendors are encouraged to propose innovative solutions while limiting unnecessary restrictions.
6. Evaluation Criteria
Proposals will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. Understanding of the Project – Demonstrated comprehension of the objectives, scope, and deliverables.
2. Technical Approach – The feasibility and robustness of the proposed technical solution.
3. Past Performance – Relevant experience and success in similar projects.
4. Team Qualifications – Expertise and skills of the proposed team members.
5. Cost/Value – Overall cost and value for money.
6. Prequalification Detection Capability – Effectiveness of detecting and flagging pre qualification requirements.
Evaluation factors must be closely linked to the stated requirements, and the proposal should contain only essential informationacquisition.gov.

7. Future Considerations
While the initial engagement focuses on one state or county, the solution must be designed for expansion to multiple regions and corporate scanning. Vendors should briefly describe how their solution could scale and integrate with Microsoft vendor certification processes.
